# Sleuth

Sleuth is a  JavaScript library (based on jQuery) in which you can write tests to ensure that expected code patterns have been implemented by developers who take your code and tie them into a CMS or similar and provide instant feedback on what's gone wrong so they can go about fixing things themselves.

The idea was to cut down on the situations where you spend a number of hours, days trying to communicate that the reason that the code you supplied isn't working is down to the fact that they've not implemented it correctly.

More information and example to follow soon.

I'm already using a tool like this on my client work but as it was developed pretty much while at work the possibilities to stick it online were risky. Therefore it's getting a bit of a re-write.
